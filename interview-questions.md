Functional Programming cannot store data in objects and must manipulated by creating functions. While the most basic of elements of OOP are objects and methods, in Functional elements are variables and functions. OOP is good for fixed sets of operations with new things primarily being added as the code evolves Functional deals with a fixed set of things that add new operations on the existing things as our code evolves.
